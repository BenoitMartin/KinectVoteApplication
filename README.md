# KinectVoteApplication
A school project of voting with the kinect

The subject was about elections and votes. We splitted in 4 groups.
Each one had a different approach. The 4 approach were :
- Kinect Vote Application
- Leap Motion Vote Application
- WPF Client Vote Application
- Server with webservices to collect the data and share the available elections.

I was part of the group which was on the Kinect Vote Application.
We have started by using an old example to understand how the kinect works, and which criterias we were gonna use.

We've started by programming a serie of test. We'ha used the test class of C#. 
After we've done the initialization procedure with the arms in T. And after the Vote Yes and the Vote No.
At the end, we've programmed the part that will send the vote to the Server via one of his webservices.
